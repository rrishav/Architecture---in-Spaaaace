 Babylonian Method to find the algorithm.

Algorithm:

Make a guess, here I have assigned the number itself as the guess value.
Divide the original number by the guess.
Set an error limit (Here I have set the error limit as 0.0000001)
Now subtract the quotient (from step 2) from the guessed number.
Now check if the number from the step 4 is greater than the error.
if it is, then set the guessed number as (sum of the last guessed number and the quotient from step 2) divided by 2.
Iterate steps 4 - 6 until the value from step 3 is less then the error value.
Once this condition is met, you will get the squre-root of the desired number.
