# Architecture---in-Spaaaace
You are a the Chief Computronist on the first intersolar survey vessel. While studying a planet likely suitable for colonization your ship encountered an alien ship. During attempts at contact there was some misunderstanding or error. The alients opened fire and quickly retreated. They left you in a decaying orbit with heavy damage to astrogation and navigation. You and the Chief Engineer have found that, while extensive, much of the damage seems superficial. The main control and calculation circuits are intact, but the interface to them is a pile of slag. You need to rebuilt the interface from spare parts before your orbit decays and you become unintentional colonists - at high speed. Luckily you had some of the datasheets for the hardware printed out, although they suffered some plasma burns. N.B. You will need to generate wire diagrams of some sophistication and size below. It is STRONGLY recommended that you use a drawing tool to generate them. There are a number of free drawing tools like DIA or GiMP that run on many operating systems. It is also recommended that you color-code the path your inputs take through your diagrams. For instance, red for 'A', blue for 'B' and so on.
